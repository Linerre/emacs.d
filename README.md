# Nothing special
This is just my emacs.d, nothing more. When it comes to a highly configurable editor like Emacs, I think the **best** approach to it is to steal from others' configs and build my own. So steal from, instead of simply cloning, my config and build your own over time.

The trade-off will be tremendous.
